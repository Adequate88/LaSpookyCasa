# Narrative Planning

(Refined by GPT)

A seven-year-old boy is left home alone while his parents go away on a short trip. In his room, he finds a note from his mother (which the player must interact with). The note reads like a simple task list: clean his room and tidy up the house while they are gone.

At first, everything feels normal—quiet, almost liberating. The boy realizes he doesn’t have to follow the rules and decides to ignore the chores. He plays around, does what he wants, and eventually goes to sleep without completing any of the tasks. (Not fully convinced yet for using cleaning the room as a consequence. Might not be needed).

That night, the consequences begin. The chores were more than simple rules—they were what kept him safe. As he sleeps, faint sounds stir him awake. At first, they seem distant. Then, closer. Something else is in the house. Something else is in his room.

He grabs his flashlight and scans the space. Nothing. He convinces himself it’s his imagination and switches the light off. But the moment he does, the sounds grow louder, faster, pressing in. Suddenly, a puppet’s face flashes before him and vanishes. The screen fades to black.

The next morning, he wakes up. His room looks the same, but something is off. The note from his mother is no longer the same: its color now matches the puppet from the night before, and the handwriting is different. Interacting with it reveals new words:

“Will you play hide and seek with me? Hope you find me before midnight.”

As the boy lowers the note, a childlike laugh echoes in the room. As the laughter fades, a clock appears in the top-right corner of the screen, marking the start of the countdown.

# Room Planning

The room will contain:

- A bed
- A window
- A set of portraits and images
- Toys 
- A carpet
- Bookshelf
- A calendar on the wall
- Large wardrobe

# What are anomalies?

Anomalies are the mode in which the monster manifests in the room. Anomalies are the monsters 'hiding' in this game of hide and seek. 

These anomalies appear in the room after the first night. These anomalies appear as everyday objects that have similar colors/strange artifacts that resemble the monster (almost as if the monster has possessed these objects).



!!!! Random idea:

Ok, what if we split the day (isometric part of the game) into 2 parts. First is early day/afternoon. At this stage the player actually just has to go around and clean his room. But in this sense, cleaning will literally just be allowing the player to re-arrange objects in the images in a way that they want (potentially aiding themselves to find the anomalies later). Then, evening comes at a certain point. Here, the lights go out and the player can only use the flashlight. Then, they must go around the room again, but now with only the flashlight. Here, the player is playing the hide and seek. Only in the evening does the monster appear and manifest itself in objects. And now, the player must scan each image with the flashlight to find the anomalies. This can help us balance the game by making it more difficult to find annomalies. Additionally, it gives the player strategy to consider in the day time.

Maybe, we can use the same mechanic we thought of in the sleep period here. You have to flash the light on the anomaly to make it go away. Then, when you actually go to sleep in the evening, you do one final sweep of the room from the first person perspective to try and catch the final anomalies that might just be around in the room.

I feel like narrativewise this also feels more natural cause then it kindof connects with the night time being scary for a child, and that day time is safe. (Maybe we even add an additional mechanic that gives the player life? But instead of calling it health we call it sanity or something, and there is a way to reduce insanity in the day time, but missing anomalies cause jumpscares + insanity to go up)

# Game Progression

8 Days (although 7 is the ideal nicer number)

Each day will consist of the hours from 10h00 to 24h00. 

At any point in the day, the player is allowed to interact with the bed and end the day cycle. 

However, if 24h00 is reached and the player has not manually chosen to rest, then they will be forced into the next cycle (potential expansion of this to be discussed)

The maximum number of anomilies associated with each monster will be 6 (for a given day). Each monster will have 7 'lives' in the night cycle. For each anomaly found in the day cycle, you subtract from the monsters life count.

Day 1 (Daytime):

Only the childs room is available (thus only the first monster).

The child is allowed to explore the room and interact with the room. For day one, there will be only one anomaly hidden (one that is rather obvious).

Day 1 (Night):

The player will learn for the first time the night phase, which will switch perspectives from viewing the game from 3rd person to 1st person. The player will have access to a flashlight, which they can turn on and off for that evening. The battery life is limited to a total of X minutes of active time. Once the battery runs out, the player is left in darkness. 

(To be further discussed) At any point in the night cycle, the player is allowed to go back to sleep by pressing a key. If done so, there will be a slight 'animation' showing the players eyes closing and fading to black. If the monsters have not been found in the night cycle, the player will experience a jump scare. Otherwise, they proceed to the next day.

Day 2 (Daytime):

Boy wakes up with altered note. It reads to the boy that the monster wants to play hide and seek. Tells the boy that he only has until midnight.

Still only bedroom available, but this time more anomolies. Anomilies on this day will be 3 or 4, with 1 being significantly more difficult (we need to discuss more player feedback so that they know they missed an anomaly).

Day 2 (Night):

Same as before, but now (potentially) the monster may live for longer as the player will have missed a difficult anomaly.

Day 3 (Daytime):

A new note is available for the player: "Can my friends play too? Don't forget to wash your hands"

The bathroom is now available, at this point the room will reach 4/5 anomalies and the bathroom will only have 1 (semi-obvious one).

Once the hallway is introduced there is a lot of additional fear factor that is possible to implement. For example, the hallway can contain portraits the swap and change images to spookier images. There can also be flashing lights and darkness. 

Day 3 (Night):

Same as before but now we introduce the new monster. This monster will enter delayed and will be queued in by a particular sound (something related to the bathroom and the monster walking down the hall + door creaking).

Day 4 (Daytime):

Bed room reaches max anomalies. Bathroom increases to 3.

Day 4 (Night):

Same as before.

Day 5 (Daytime):

Livingroom/kitchen introduced as a room with its own unique monster. This will contain 1 anomaly. 

Bedroom stays at 6 total anomalies (they don't necessarily need to be the same). 

Bathroom increases to 5.

Day 5 (Night):

New monster introduced, arrives after the bathroom monster with its own unique sound queue.

Day 6 (Daytime):

Room stays the same.
Bathroom maxed to 6.
Living room increased to 4.

Day 6 (Night):

Same as before.

Day 7 (Daytime):

All rooms maxed to 6.

Day 7 (Night):

Same as before, but if the player lives, the game ends and we pass to an end screen.

# Places the player can interact with

- Under the bed
- Inside the closet
- Above his wardrobe/cabinet
- Amongst all his toys (sitting in a corner?)
- On his bookshelf 

# Monsters and their personalities

## Monster 1: Stuffed Rabbit in the boy's room(?)

This monster is a stuffed rabbit...

The rabbit is a playful monster. It likes to play games and tease the boy.

## Monster 2: .... in the bathroom



## Monster 3: Stitched (plushy) cat in the kitchen (?)

The cat is a 'sassy' and entitled monster. Just like a cat it believes that it is the center of the universe. It doesn't like making things easy for the player. It actively sabotages the player and, because its a cat, doesn't respect boundaries. Therefore, it is able to wander into any of the rooms ontop of the kitchen.
