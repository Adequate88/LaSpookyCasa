# Document for Brainstorming GenAI Game (Temporarily named to README.md - change once brainstorming is completed)

- Studio Name: Triple A
- Genre: Horror + ?

## Themes

- Abominations (basically monsters)

- Playing off idea of 'Guess AI Generated Images'

- Spotting 'zombies' similar-ish to papers please

## Setting

- A house (liminal space)
- AI Landlord/Housing Agency 
    - House viewing/moving in

## Narrative

You moved into a house with an AI landlord.

Option 1: As 'time' progresses, the AI deteriorates and consequently the game becomes more uncanny. Strange things are said by the AI and stranger things keep occuring in the home.

Option 2: AI is obsessed of learning about humans/want to become human. This gives motivation for the AI breaking in and moving stuff.

Option 3: AI 'threatens' user with a benign seeming task that they must complete everyday - otherwise, something 'bad' will happen. This benign seeming thing can actually relate to something the AI is doing which is quite nasty.

This turns the game into one where the user is eventually trying to discover and learn what the AI is actually doing with this seemingly benign task.

You perform simple tasks in your home, like cleaning your room. Each day things are scattered around and misplaced, you dont know why. Each progressive day you must redo these tasks but there seem to be anomolies.

You can go to sleep whenever you want, but if you miss an anomoly before you go to sleep then spooky.


## Horror Spooks

- Objects out of place after returning
- Spooky Images (AI generated)


## Core Gameplay Loop

- Point and Click interactions (displays images)

## What is the AI?

1. Humanoid body
2. House Integrated AI: means that the AI can't actually perform physical tasks

## Things we are not confident on

- How does the game end?
- What is the benign task?
- What is the AIs goals?
- How is the AI trying to stop us?
- What do you do during the day?
